# Simulator

## Simulator to compare different control strategies within an obstacle map.
- Uses abstract classes to construct simulators.
- Vector- and Raster= based simulators supported.
- Simulations can be run sequentially or in parallel.

## TODO
- Add logging of results for quick processing.
- Add Monte-Carlo simulation option.
- Add multi-threading to speed up large-scale simulations.
- Generate statistical report that compare different control strategies in specific scenarios.
